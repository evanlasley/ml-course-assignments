# Machine Learning Course: Programming Assignments 
If you are taking this course, do not refer to any code in this repository before the due date for your assignment. Likewise, never post any code from this repository on other sites or discussion groups where it could be seen by other students. Otherwise, any questions or insights on machine learning are, of course, welcome. 

### The Stanford Honor Code:  
"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
